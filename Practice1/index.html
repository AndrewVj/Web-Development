            <blockquote>This maiden she lived with no other thought, Than to love and be loved by me. <br /><br /><br /> 
              
              I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as the Rhythmical Creation of Beauty.
              Its sole arbiter is Taste. <br /><br /><br />
              
              Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
              Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dreamed before. <br /><br /><br />
              
              The skies they were ashen and sober;
              The leaves they were crisped and sere â€” The leaves they were withering and sere;
              It was night in the lonesome October,
              Of my most immemorial year.
