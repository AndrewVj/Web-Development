                Although it was not declared the provincial flower of
                Newfoundland and Labrador until 1954, this strange plant
                appeared on the Newfoundland penny during the late 1880s. The

                >
                is found primarily in bogs and marshland throughout the
                province. It has a large wine-red flower and hollow
                pitcher-shaped leaves are attached to the base of the stem. An
                insectivorous plant, it feeds off insects that become trapped
                inside when the leaves fill with water.

              <p>
                Designated as the provincial tree in November 1993, it is also
                known as the bog spruce. Although dark bluish-green in colour,
                it is called the "black" spruce to distinguish it from other
                types of spruce trees. An evergreen coniferous tree, it is
                tolerant of nutrient-deficient soils, growing primarily in areas
                that have poor drainage. The
                <a href="www.borealforest.org/trees/tree7.htm">black spruce</a>
                is the most abundant tree in Labrador and appears on the
                Labrador flag.

                has officially been the provincial bird of Newfoundland and
                Labrador since 1991. It is a member of the auk family. The
                puffin is also called the sea parrot because of its
                multi-coloured beak. Marine birds that inhabit cliffs, puffins
                can dive 50 metres underwater in search of food. Their diet
                consists mostly of small fish such as caplin and herring. Their
                wing span is approximately 55 cm., and they can fly up to 80 km.
                per hour. Puffins spend the majority oftheir lives on the water.
                They live approximately 25 years, usually mate for life, and
                produce one egg per year. Witless Bay, Newfoundland, is home to
                the largest puffin colony in North America.

                A mineral discovered in northern Labrador, it was first
                described by Moravian missionaries in the late 18th century and
                brought to Europe. An iridescent crystalline mineral, it is from
                the plagioclase feldspar group. It is prized for its beautiful
                shifting iridescent colours of blue, green, grey and bronze.
                Found largely in the Nain area of Labrador, it is being mined at
                Ten Mile Bay by the Labrador Inuit Association.

                The provincial tartan was developed in 1955 by Sam Wilansky, a
                clothing store owner on Water Street in St. John's. The tartan
                is predominantly green with gold, white, brown and red bands of
                colour. He chose most of the colours to correspond with
