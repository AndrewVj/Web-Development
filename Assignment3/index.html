          BMW introduced the M8 Gran Coupé Concept, which previewed a high
          performance four-door variant of the Concept 8 Series at the the 2017
          Frankfurt Motor Show. It generated a lot of interest among car
          enthusists. Finally roduction began in
          <time datetime="2019-08-xx">August 2019</time>.The
          <strong><em>BMW M8 Gran Coupe</em></strong> is one of the most
          prestigious and luxurious sports car that BMW currently offers. And it
          is not just a delight to look at. It is also a delight to drive
          around. The car is guaranteed to get you attention while driving it
          around both in the city and in the highways. Well this should come as
          no surprise given how stunningly gorgeous it looks.Under the hood is a
          silky <strong>617-hp twin-turbo V-8 engine</strong>, a snappy
          eight-speed automatic, and an all-wheel-drive system with a rear-drive
          mode that enables drifts and burnouts.When it comes to competition it
          stands against other big-mile GT bruisers like Mercedes’ AMG GT 4-door
          Coupe, the Porsche Panamera and Bentley’s Flying Spur.The M8 has the
          ability to satisfy a lot of our expectations. And it rightly should.
          It doesn't come cheap. With a hefty starting price of around
          <strong>$130,000</strong> the M8 goes on to satisfy a lot of our
          expectations if not all. Let us look at those in detail.

        <h2>Exterior</h2>
        <p>
          The M8 is a 4 door - sedan and pretty big one at it. The fit and
          finish are what you would expect from such a luxurious car. They are
          perfect. The iconic front grill, the BMW logo and the projection
          headlamps upfront make it look really stunning. And of course like
          most other sports cars you can always go for after market
          modifications to make it look even more menacing. The model of course
          comes in plenty of color options. Red, Blue and Green colors make the
          car stand out even more. The car looks absolutely stunning no matter
          which angle you look at it from. The beefy rear portion with gorgeous
          back lights and the stunning alloy wheels are the cherry on top.

        <h2>Interior</h2>
        <p>
          The M8 Gran Coupe features an exquisite interior that looks as rich as
          it feels. While the design is more dignified than dazzling, the
          four-door M8 provides plentiful rear passenger space. It also offers
          tons of desirable standard features such as a 12.3-inch digital gauge
          cluster, 16-way power front seats with memory settings, heating, and
          ventilation, four-zone climate control, leather upholstery, and
          more.Buyers can also enhance the cabin with novel color schemes and
          fancy trims as well as a Comfort Seating package. This adds heated
          seats throughout along with power sunshades for rear-seat passengers.
          While the back seat features three seatbelts.

          The Gran Coupe is quite a bit longer than the 8 Series Coupe and the
          widest car that BMW currently makes, so space inside for four adults
          is good. Those in that front can stretch out, while only the very tall
          will complain about headroom in the rear. Every M8 Gran Coupe is
          equipped with a 10.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system that can
          also be operated with a rotary controller on the center console. Along
          with its 16-speaker Harman/Kardon sound system, the brawny BMW has a
          Wi-Fi hotspot and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard.

            The M8 Gran Coupe is powered by a lusty twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8
            that makes 617 horsepower.The exceptionally smooth engine sends that
            power to all four wheels via a responsive eight-speed automatic
            transmission. However, tail-out antics are made possible by a
            selectable rear-wheel-drive mode that routes all the V-8's fury to
            the back. This rocket-powered four-door shot to 60 mph in just 2.7
            seconds and completed the quarter-mile in 10.8 ticks at 129
            mph.While it's furiously quick and provides more than 1.0 g of
            cornering grip, the big M8 suffers from indifferent steering feel
            and a stiff ride that compromises its comfort. A specially tuned
            adaptive suspension comes standard, and it can be adjusted through
            the sedan's customizable or preset drive modes, but even the softest
            damper setting isn't soft at all.
            <br />
            <br />
            With estimates of 15 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on the highway, the
            V-8-powered M8 Gran Coupe certainly won't be confused for a hybrid.
            However, those figures are on par with other fast four-doors in this
            class. Now coming to the way it sounds. And boy does it sound good.
            The V-8 engine roars like a proper powerful sports car. Don't belive
            me? Well here it yourself.

        <p>
          BMW have a winner with respect to the M8 Gran Coupe. Although on the
          pricey side this is definitely a car to consider if one can afford it.
          It offers a unique experience of comining fun with elegance and
          luxury.Whether you will be riding the car or travelling as a pillion.
          And you surely won't be disappointed.
