                BMW introduced the M8 Gran Coupé Concept, which previewed a high performance four-door variant 
                of the Concept 8 Series at the the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. It generated a lot of interest among car enthusists. 
                Finally roduction began in <time datetime="2019-08-xx">August 2019</time>.The <strong><em>BMW M8 Gran Coupe</em></strong> is one of the most prestigious and luxurious
                sports car that BMW currently offers. And it is not just a delight to
                look at. It is also a delight to drive around. The car is guaranteed
                to get you attention while driving it around both in the city and in
                the highways. Well this should come as no surprise given how
                stunningly gorgeous it looks.Under the hood is a silky
                <strong>617-hp twin-turbo V-8 engine</strong>, a snappy eight-speed
                automatic, and an all-wheel-drive system with a rear-drive mode that
                enables drifts and burnouts.When it comes to competition it stands
                against other big-mile GT bruisers like Mercedes’ AMG GT 4-door Coupe,
                the Porsche Panamera and Bentley’s Flying Spur.The M8 has the ability
                to satisfy a lot of our expectations. And it rightly should. It
                doesn't come cheap. With a hefty starting price of around
                <strong>$130,000</strong> the M8 goes on to satisfy a lot of our
                expectations if not all. Let us look at those in detail.

        <h2>Exterior</h2>
        <p>
          The M8 is a 4 door - sedan and pretty big one at it. The fit and finish 
          are what you would expect from such a luxurious car. They are perfect. 
          The iconic front grill, the BMW logo and the projection headlamps upfront make 
          it look really stunning. And of course like most other sports cars you can 
          always go for after market modifications to make it look even more menacing. 
          The model of course comes in plenty of color options. Red, Blue and Green colors make the car stand out even more.

          The car looks absolutely stunning no matter which angle you look at it from. 
          The beefy rear portion with gorgeous back lights and the stunning alloy wheels are the cherry on top.

        <h2>Interior</h2>
        <p>
          The M8 Gran Coupe features an exquisite interior that
          looks as rich as it feels. While the design is more dignified than
          dazzling, the four-door M8 provides plentiful rear passenger space. It
          also offers tons of desirable standard features such as a
          12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, 16-way power front seats with memory
          settings, heating, and ventilation, four-zone climate control, leather
          upholstery, and more.Buyers can also enhance the cabin with novel
          color schemes and fancy trims as well as a Comfort Seating package.
          This adds heated seats throughout along with power sunshades for
          rear-seat passengers. While the back seat features three seatbelts.

          The Gran Coupe is quite a bit longer than the 8 Series Coupe and the
          widest car that BMW currently makes, so space inside for four adults
          is good. Those in that front can stretch out, while only the very tall
          will complain about headroom in the rear. Every M8 Gran Coupe is
          equipped with a 10.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system that can
          also be operated with a rotary controller on the center console. Along
          with its 16-speaker Harman/Kardon sound system, the brawny BMW has a
          Wi-Fi hotspot and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard.

                The M8 Gran Coupe is powered by a lusty twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that
          makes 617 horsepower.The exceptionally smooth engine sends that power
          to all four wheels via a responsive eight-speed automatic
          transmission. However, tail-out antics are made possible by a
          selectable rear-wheel-drive mode that routes all the V-8's fury to the
          back. This rocket-powered four-door shot to 60 mph in just 2.7 seconds
          and completed the quarter-mile in 10.8 ticks at 129 mph.While it's
          furiously quick and provides more than 1.0 g of cornering grip, the
          big M8 suffers from indifferent steering feel and a stiff ride that
          compromises its comfort. A specially tuned adaptive suspension comes
          standard, and it can be adjusted through the sedan's customizable or
          preset drive modes, but even the softest damper setting isn't soft at
          all.

          With estimates of 15 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on the highway, the
          V-8-powered M8 Gran Coupe certainly won't be confused for a hybrid.
          However, those figures are on par with other fast four-doors in this
          class. Now coming to the way it sounds. And boy does it sound good.
          The V-8 engine roars like a proper powerful sports car.
          Don't belive me? Well here it yourself.
